I am Web developer, Angular expert and JavaScript enthusiast from the vibrant city of Bristol, UK.

One thing I have realised in my 4 years as a professional web developer is that I really enjoy learning. I enjoy learning new technologies, languages and concepts, as well as learning in order to gain a deeper understanding of things I already (think I) know. I hope to share some of what I learn with others through this blog.
